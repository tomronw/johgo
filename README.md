# About
[![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-yellow)](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/) <br />
JohGo is a free, open-source, search engine for UK Pok√©mon TCG products. I had the idea whilst trawling through endless
Google pages of out of stock products. Written with a mix of React/Go, it utilises ElasticSearch to hold the data from
the scrapes.

- [View the site here!](https://johgo.xyz)
- Currently scraping 70~ UK sites returning on average 12000-13000 products
- Filters out most mystery box/joblot garbage on the backend with the option to filter out single cards.
- Gets top trending search terms from the web.
- Feel free to use as a blueprint for your own project!
